### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am Vaishnavi Madhekar a final year Computer Science student. I run a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYZc6M7kL1IxxN57_ubqYMw) ðŸŽ¥ on programming stuff and I try to learn in this process. I sometimes blog on [medium](https://medium.com/@vaishnavi514) and write articles on technical stuff. Check out my article on [Docker](https://medium.com/@vaishnavi514/docker-build-ship-run-any-application-anywhere-2f75d1166b50).
